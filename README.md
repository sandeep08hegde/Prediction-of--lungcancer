This project aims to leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to enhance the early detection and diagnosis of lung cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Traditional manual detection methods through High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) images are labor-intensive. Therefore, this project aims to develop a Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) system to assist radiologists in detecting lung nodules more efficiently.

Introduction
Lung cancer, marked by the presence of nodules in the lung, is a serious health concern worldwide. Early detection of these nodules is crucial for effective treatment and improving patient survival rates. However, manual detection through HRCT images is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a CAD system that utilizes CNNs to automate the detection process.

Features
Automated detection of lung nodules in chest X-ray images.
Preprocessing techniques, including geometric mean filtering, to enhance image quality.
Segmentation techniques to isolate regions of interest (lung nodules).
CNN-based analysis for predicting lung cancer and providing precise diagnostics.
Evaluation of softmax probabilities for each class to improve accuracy.
Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
